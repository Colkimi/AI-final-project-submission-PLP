### System Components

#### 2.1 Data Layer (`src/utils/healthData.ts`)
- **Health Data Interface**: Structured data model for health metrics
- **Data Generation**: Realistic health data simulation with time-based patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered health irregularity identification
- **Historical Data Management**: Time-series data handling for trend analysis

#### 2.2 Component Architecture
```

└── App.tsx                  # Main application controller
```

#### 2.3 Health Metrics Monitored
1. **Heart Rate** (60-100 BPM normal range)
2. **Blood Oxygen Saturation** (95-100% normal range)
3. **Activity Level** (Steps per measurement period)
4. **Sleep Quality** (70-100% optimal range)

---

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Simulation Strategy
The system employs sophisticated algorithms to generate realistic health data:

```typescript
// Time-based heart rate variation
let baseHeartRate = 72;
if (hour >= 6 && hour <= 9) baseHeartRate = 68;   // Morning rest
if (hour >= 10 && hour <= 16) baseHeartRate = 75; // Active day
if (hour >= 17 && hour <= 21) baseHeartRate = 80; // Evening activity
if (hour >= 22 || hour <= 5) baseHeartRate = 65;  // Night rest
```

### 3.2 Anomaly Detection Algorithm
Multi-layered approach for health anomaly identification:

1. **Range-based Detection**: Identifies values outside normal physiological ranges
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Detects unusual metric combinations
3. **Time-pattern Recognition**: Identifies irregular patterns based on time of day
4. **Contextual Analysis**: Considers multiple metrics simultaneously

### 3.3 AI Recommendation Engine
Personalized health insights generation:

```typescript
// Health score calculation
const healthScore = (
  (heartRateNormal ? 25 : 15) +
  (bloodOxygenNormal ? 25 : 15) +
  (activityAdequate ? 25 : 10) +
  (sleepQualityGood ? 25 : 15)
);
```
